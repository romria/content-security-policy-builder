### Content Security Policy builder

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security layer that helps to prevent certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. This can be achieved by restricting which resources (JavaScript, CSS, Images, etc.) can be loaded on your website.

This project is made to simplify the process of populating CSP rules for `Content-Security-Policy` response header and `<meta>` tags.
